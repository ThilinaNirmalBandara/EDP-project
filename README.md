This is about our 2nd semester engineering design project at the University of Moratuwa, Faculty of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
We have designed a mini portable UPS that can output 9 V and 12 V simultaneously. Key features include a battery level indicator, mode indicator, 
and automatic switching between power modes.
